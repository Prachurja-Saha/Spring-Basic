To learn Spring Boot effectively, it's helpful to first understand the Spring Framework's core components and to 
acquire some foundational tech knowledge. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

### 1. **Spring Framework Components**
- `Spring Core`: Provides the foundation of the Spring Framework, including dependency injection (DI)
                and inversion of control (IoC), which manage application components and their dependencies.
- `Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)`: Adds cross-cutting concerns (like logging and security) separately from 
                                              business logic, helping you keep code modular and clean.
- `Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller)`: A web framework for building robust, MVC-based web applications. 
                                     It handles HTTP requests and serves responses using controllers, models, and views.
- `Spring Data`: Simplifies database access by providing pre-built abstractions over various data stores 
                 (like JPA, MongoDB, Redis), allowing easier CRUD operations.
- `Spring Security`: A framework for securing applications, providing features for authentication, 
                     authorization, and various security protocols.
- `Spring Batch`: Provides tools for batch processing, commonly used for data-heavy operations and scheduled tasks.
- `Spring Cloud`: Used for building microservices architectures. 
                  It includes tools for service discovery, configuration management, circuit breakers, and more.

Examples: Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS).

# Application Server:
Hosts and runs application logic, providing business logic to client applications.
Examples: Apache Tomcat, JBoss/WildFly, Oracle WebLogic, IBM WebSphere.

# Database Server:
Manages and provides access to databases, handling data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.

# Container Server:
Hosts and manages containerized applications using platforms like Docker and Kubernetes.
Examples: Docker Engine, Kubernetes clusters.

# Cloud Server:
A virtual server hosted in a cloud computing environment, providing on-demand resources and scalability.
Examples: Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute Engine.
Each type of server is designed to perform specific tasks and handle different types of requests, contributing to the overall architecture of modern IT systems.

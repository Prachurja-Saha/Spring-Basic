/*        Application Context: The Application Context is a more advanced and feature-rich version of the
          IoC container.
          While both the Application Context and the basic IoC container (like BeanFactory) provide support
          for dependency injection, the Application Context includes additional capabilities, such as:
                Event Handling: It can publish and listen for events.
                Internationalization (i18n): It supports message resources for localization.
                Bean Post Processors: It allows for customization of beans after their instantiation.
                AOP Support: It integrates with Springâ€™s Aspect-Oriented Programming features.
